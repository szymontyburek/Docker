Learned how to:
- Build a Docker image using a Dockerfile
- Create, run, and stop a Docker container
- Use volumes to share data between the host filesystem and a container
- Use the nodemon package to detect changes in files and update the code running inside an existing container
- Automate the building of images, containers, and volumes using Docker compose
